#GIF Generator
Week 6 Assignment: Ajax

## Animating Anime

This is an assignment that was given during the sixth week of the University of Miami Coding bootcamp. The Javascript will generate a series of buttons from an array. Upon clicking one of those buttons, 10 still GIFs will appear below the buttons of the topic labeled on the button. Clicking a GIF once will cause it to animate. Clicking a GIF that is currently animating will stop it. More buttons can be added in the search box on the right side of the page, of which can then be pressed to generate another 10 GIFs for the topic it's labeled for.

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to learn the concepts of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript + XML), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Using an API from Giphy, I could call upon information from their website pertaining to GIFs via an AJAX request. The information made both meaningful and usable to me was able to be viewed as a JSON, or an object holding the information of Giphy's database of GIFS.

Ultimately, the project came out quite successful, although given more time, I would like to adjust the CSS to make it more aesthetically
